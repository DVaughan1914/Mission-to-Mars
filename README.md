# Mission-to-Mars
## Background
Creating a  web app that will look good and execute succesfully. Scraping images of Mars’s hemispheres from an online source that is scraping-friendly. I would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, I'll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
